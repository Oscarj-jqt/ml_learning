Pandas python libraby for data analysis to create, manipulate data

import pandas as pd

DataFrame
It is a table (rows and columns) 2 dimensions

Example

pd.DataFrame({'Yes': [50, 21], 'No': [131, 2]})
Yes	No
0	50	131
1	21	2z

Index are rows if they are not specified it represents an id.
We can assign them to values with index =[]

Example
pd.DataFrame({'Bob': ['I liked it.', 'It was awful.'], 
              'Sue': ['Pretty good.', 'Bland.']},
             index=['Product A', 'Product B'])
Bob	Sue
Product A	I liked it.	Pretty good.
Product B	It was awful.	Bland.w

Series
It is a list 1 dimension (single column of DataFrame)

Example 

quantities = ['4 cups', '1 cup', '2 large', '1 can']
items = ['Flour', 'Milk', 'Eggs', 'Spam']
recipe = pd.Series(quantities, index=items, name='Dinner')

Datas are stocked within CSV file we use pd.read_csv() function to read the data

wine_reviews = pd.read_csv("../input/wine-reviews/winemag-data-130k-v2.csv")
We can use the shape attribute to check how large the resulting DataFrame is:

wine_reviews.shape
(129971, 14)
So our new DataFrame has 130,000 records split across 14 different columns. 
That's almost 2 million entries (multiply to get an approximative estimation ?)
.head() to get the top five entries

Use to_csv to save a DataFrame to a CSV file.
Example 

animals = pd.DataFrame({'Cows': [12, 20], 'Goats': [22, 19]}, index=['Year 1', 'Year 2'])
animals.to_csv("cows_and_goats.csv")
