Pandas python libraby for data analysis to create, manipulate data

import pandas as pd

DataFrame
It is a table (rows and columns) 2 dimensions

Example

pd.DataFrame({'Yes': [50, 21], 'No': [131, 2]})
Yes	No
0	50	131
1	21	2z

Index are rows if they are not specified it represents an id.
We can assign them to values with index =[]

Example
pd.DataFrame({'Bob': ['I liked it.', 'It was awful.'], 
              'Sue': ['Pretty good.', 'Bland.']},
             index=['Product A', 'Product B'])
Bob	Sue
Product A	I liked it.	Pretty good.
Product B	It was awful.	Bland.w

Series
It is a list 1 dimension (single column of DataFrame)

Example 

pd.Series([30, 35, 40], index=['2015 Sales', '2016 Sales', '2017 Sales'], name='Product A')
2015 Sales    30
2016 Sales    35
2017 Sales    40
Name: Product A, dtype: int64

Datas are stocked within CSV file we use pd.read_csv() function to read the data

wine_reviews = pd.read_csv("../input/wine-reviews/winemag-data-130k-v2.csv")
We can use the shape attribute to check how large the resulting DataFrame is:

wine_reviews.shape
(129971, 14)
So our new DataFrame has 130,000 records split across 14 different columns. 
That's almost 2 million entries (multiply to get an approximative estimation ?)
.head() to get the top five entries
