Pandas python libraby to manipulate datas by using this commande

import pandas as pd
file_path = mypath
data = pd.read_csv(file_path)
print(data)
data.describe()

Example where we read datas in a file describing home prices in Melbourn, Australia 

# save filepath to variable for easier access
melbourne_file_path = '../input/melbourne-housing-snapshot/melb_data.csv'
# read the data and store data in DataFrame titled melbourne_data
melbourne_data = pd.read_csv(melbourne_file_path) 
# print a summary of the data in Melbourne data
melbourne_data.describe()

To display dataset columns
print(dataset.columns)

# Create the list of features below
feature_names = ["LotArea","YearBuilt","1stFlrSF",
"2ndFlrSF", "FullBath", "BedroomAbvGr", "TotRmsAbvGrd"]

# Select data corresponding to features in feature_names
X = home_data[feature_names]
print(X)
