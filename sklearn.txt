scikit-learn library to create models
# Import library
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor

# Initialize the model
iowa_model = DecisionTreeRegressor(random_state=1)

# Train the model
iowa_model.fit(X, y)
X are datas with features we selected before
y is a precise feature

# Make Predictions 
predictions = model.predict(X)
